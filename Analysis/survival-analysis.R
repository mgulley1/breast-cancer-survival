#### data ####

cancer_data <- read_csv("Data/bc_data.csv")
# loads data related to survival of patients with
# breat cancer

names(cancer_data)
# lists the column names of the cancer_data data
# frame. There are 5 columns, dep is a patient's
# deprivation score, region is the area they live,
# agediag is a patient's age at diagnosis, dead is
# whether the patient died during the study, survtime
# is the length of time a patient was known to survive
# after diagnosis

str(cancer_data)
# shows the data types of each column. dep, region 
# and dead are character variables, it makes more
# sense to recode these variables as factors

cancer_data$dep <- factor(cancer_data$dep, 
                          levels = c("leastdep", 2, 3, 4, "mostdep"))
# converts dep variable to a factor with suitable levels
cancer_data$region <- factor(cancer_data$region)
# converts the region variable to a factor
cancer_data$dead <- factor(cancer_data$dead, 
                           levels = c("alive/ce", "dead"))
# converts dep to a factor with suitable levels

str(cancer_data)
# shows the data types of each column to check the
# variables have been converted to factors correctly

summary(cancer_data)
# provides summary counts and statistics for the whole
# dataset

#### Cox proportional hazards model ####

# region to predict hazard function for patients with breast cancer

tbl_regression(cox_bc)
# creates a nice table to show the statistics for the cox
# proportionate hazards model variables

tbl_regression(cox_bc, exp = TRUE)
# creates the same table as above except the output
# has been exponentiated to give statistics for the
# hazards ratio rather than log hazard ratio
