# breast-cancer-survival
Here we use survival analysis methods to assess the impact of varibles on the survival of patients with breast cancer. This includes producing
plots to assess the distribution of variables within in the data as well as fitting Kaplan-Meier survival curves and fitting the data to a Cox Proportional 
Hazards model to provide inference on patients' survival.
