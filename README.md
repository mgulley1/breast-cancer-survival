# breast-cancer-survival
Here we use survival analysis methods to assess the impact of variables on the survival of patients with breast cancer. This includes producing
plots to assess the distribution of variables within the data as well as fitting Kaplan-Meier survival curves and a Cox Proportional 
Hazards model to the data to provide inference on patients' survival.
